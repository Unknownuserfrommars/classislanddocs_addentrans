# URI Navigation

::: info
This article explains how users can use URI navigation. If you want to learn how to register custom URIs in ClassIsland, please refer to [Developing URI Navigations](../dev/uri-navigation.md)ã€‚
:::

ClassIsland supports navigation within the app using URIs, and also registers a URL protocol in the system so that ClassIsland functions can be called externally.

The default URI navigation protocol for ClassIsland is `classisland://`. Built-in navigation paths are under `classisland://app/`, while plugin extension paths are generally under `classisland://plugins/`.

## Register URI Protocol

You can enable the Register URL Protocol option in [App Settings -> General](classisland://app/settings/general) to register the URL navigation protocol.

::: warning
In some cases, certain antivirus software may treat Register URL Protocol as a sensitive behavior and block it. If this happens when enabling the feature, please click Allow.
:::

Once registered, you can test whether it works by running [`classisland://app/test`](classisland://app/test) in App Test.

## Supported Features
